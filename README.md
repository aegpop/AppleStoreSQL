# AppleStoreSQL

I started my analysis with some simple insights:

1 - Number of apps in each database

2 - Missing values
3 - Number of apps per genre

Then I proceeded with a more robust analysis:

4 - Overview of app ratings
5 - Do paid apps have higher ratings than free apps?
6 - Do apps that support more languages have higher ratings?
7 - Is there a correlation between the length of the description and the ratings?
8 - Top-rated app for each genre
